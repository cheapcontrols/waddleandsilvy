			<h2>New Game From NFL Enthusiasts Targets Girls</h2> 
			<p class="author"><b>Editor N Charge - 2019-01-24</b></p> 
			<p class="paragraph"> 
				In an attempt to get more girls into STEM fields. A local game manufacturer is developing a new game. 
				Although the title has not yet been determined a few details have been disclosed. The designers spent 
				many years watching the NFL and want to give back while improving the NFL image. They want to have an 
				impact on all four aspects of the STEM fields.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				The first part of the game will focus on science, specifically chemistry. Imagine you are a student 
				and you want to achieve more and be better. Is there a way to use chemistry to enhance your learning 
				ability? The game will come with a few chemicals that the girls can experiment with. Tests will be 
				given after the girls create and test some samples. The better the enhancer the more points you can 
				accumulate. There will also be a physical aspect to this section because equality is not just in the 
				classroom.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				The second section will apply to technology. This involves scripted scenarios where the girls will 
				use their smart devices to record different things and then afterward points will be given out based 
				on recording positive things and more importantly not recording negative things. There will also be a 
				section on selfies and how they display inner beauty by showing their outer beauty. The designers want 
				to make sure that the girls know that NFL players have a reputation to uphold.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				The third section would involve engineering. The girls would be given a layout of a house and have to 
				decide the best placement of necessary rooms like the laundry and the kitchen. They would also have to 
				determine the optimum layout so snacks can be ready in case their husband or boyfriend has a few friends
				over.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				The final section was the most difficult to come up with. The athletes themselves were not sure what 
				the word mathematics means. It took a couple lessons for them to figure out the importance of math. We 
				spent some time going over when to decide on a two-point conversion and discussed how their agent 
				negotiates their salary. Once it was explained to them in a language they could understand, they decided 
				to leave math out. All of the NFL players interviewed felt it was better if their ex-wives new less about 
				math and finances.
