				<p class="question">
					IS THIS THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE?
				</p>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Now, this may or may not be the official website.  While placing one hand on my chin and looking far into the distance I was able to recall a sunny 
						spring afternoon in 1989.  Marc Silverman and I were hanging out in Lewis Park.  It was a little strange a Bommer resident with a snobby Brush Tower resident. 
						Things get strange after picking up a twelve-pack from Pinch Penny.  I will admit he may have been a bit tipsy and I have missplaced the napkin 
						but there was a gentlemanâ€™s agreement.
						It was obvious that he would soon be working with one of the current Chicago Bear Players.  To be honest he was hoping for Jim Morrissey.  Everyone 
						should know about Silvy's man-crush on the old Door's singer Jim Morrison, but that is a story for another day.  To make a long story short he agreed
						to let me build his website under the following conditions.  You must understand that Slippery Silvy was also studying genetics while a Freshman at his 
						alma mater.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							His genetic engineering lab slips XX chromosomes into the Cheerios of an unsuspecting Tom Waddle cursing him with 4 daughters.(Tom, We know you love your daughters)
						</li>
						<li>
							His genetic engineering lab does not have a slip up and releseae material causing a global pandemic. 
						</li>
						<li>
							The bulls win 6 possibly 7 championships.
						</li>
						<li>
							His secret favorite team (The Sox) win 2 world series.( Come on man, your kid ain't becoming a sox fan on his own)
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						So, you can see the answer is a little shakey so we will leave it to the reader to determine if this is the official site or not.
