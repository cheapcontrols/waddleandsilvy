			<h2>Michael Jordan, Baseball - The Real Story?</h2> 
			<p class="author"><b>Editor N Charge - 2021-09-05</b></p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				Michael Jordan has been my favorite athlete for years.  I have always admired when other athletes talk about Mike’s desire to win and drive to be the best.  However, <q>Why did he quit baseball?</q> is the question that 90 percent of America asks.  A few weeks ago, an opportunity arose for which to find the answer.  A long time Jordan coaches sat down with me for an off-the-record discussion.  The readers of this publication should know that nothing is off-the-record.  Pop Fisher should have checked before the interview.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				Pop started by praising MJ’s work ethic, but the discussion quickly diverted to Michael’s temper.  He feels this is where MJ went off the rails.  To be clear, this had nothing to do with his temper on the field.  The issue was purely off the field.  In basketball, Michael was the leader on the offensive and defensive side of the ball.  He ran the Bulls with an Iron fist.  He was often heard not quoting Danny Rand <q>Never let the enemy choose the battlefield.  Always work from a position of strength</q>.  The misquotes by writers are why the legend of MJ has stood the test of time.  It is also why he had some issues with baseball.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				His primary contention was playing as a right fielder while on defense.  He couldn’t understand how to run the defense from way out in the right field.  He wanted to pitch, but Pop wouldn’t allow it.  Pop was miss-quoted as saying <q>I’m going to pay his salary, but I ain’t never going to let him pitch</q>.  Michael and Pop would go round and round.  I remember watching Michael try to yell at all the other players but getting frustrated when they couldn’t hear him.  Pop admitted that the other players would get annoyed at Michael and just pretend they couldn’t hear his demands.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				Michael tried to get all the players to wear Bluetooth headsets while playing defense.  This way, they could communicate better during the game.  When other players asked Michael what Bluetooth was, he lost his mind.  He always keeps up with the latest technologies.  MJ felt that Bluetooth would assist his current career and was deeply upset that others were unaware of the technology.  There were rumors that Bluetooth was developed purely to assist Michael excel with the White Sox.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				The final straw was Michaels' inability to use Bluetooth technology to run the defense. He threw 14 jars of pickles into the clubhouse and left baseball forever. He briefly considered a stint in the WWE but decided to go back to something he had already mastered. Everyone lost a little bit of respect for Micheal when he quit. Remember, quitters never win and winners always read The Stupid Weekly.

			<h2>No Surprise Here</h2> 
			<p class="author"><b>Ed Malloy - 2019-09-05</b></p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				I‘m not surprised that he gave up and went back to basketball.  A few years ago, I tried out for the New York Knickerbockers.   Michael was in his prime back then, and I figure to play with the best, you should train with the best.  I wasn’t about to be shown up on the court and lose some of my hunkiness.  After about an hour of training and dunking on him like he was my little sister, I decided the NBA was just not enough of a challenge.  I put my knowledge and prowess into something that would make the world a better place.  There is no better way than investigative reporting.  I briefly considered a stint as an all-star pickle farmer, but I thought better of it after being showered with pickles on the NBA court.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				Investigative reporting has given me experiences far more significant than I would have gotten in the NBA.  The star quality of a reporter far outshines that of an NBA player.  You ladies know what I am talking about.  Keep those emails coming to hunkyman@allstud.net.  I am surprised we are even talking about a has-been basketball player.  It’s not like he is all that famous or memorable.  I imagine him sitting on a beach, homeless and drinking pickle juice.   I don’t believe he ever had a real job.  MJ probably doesn’t have a penny to his name.  I think last I heard, his kids are supporting him.

			<h2>Who Cares?</h2> 
			<p class="author"><b>Sarah Jean Williams - 2019-09-05</b></p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				We should be spending our time looking into saving the Flutterbird.  Why do we care about the conspiracy that went into Michael Jordan leaving MLB?  It is obvious that he was either tricked or paid off.  The only conclusion I can establish is he is either stupid or corrupt.  I don’t see how that helps AOC save the planet or me save the Flutterbird.  I suspect the editor is trying to relive his childhood or something equally immature and stupid.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				I think he was either tricked or paid off because there is no reason MJ should have left baseball.  After a quiet morning of Dill pickle skeet shooting with my pop, I would sit and watch baseball.  MJ had one of the top WHIP ratings at 1.005.  He had a wins above replacement rating a bit over 100.  His curveball had a devastating break over the outside corner, and he could follow it up with the high heat.  The part I liked best was that he was not afraid to pay a little retribution if a fellow player got hit.  You all know, I know something about retribution.  I just can’t help but think this whole thing is a bit juvenile.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				I think picking out a nice pair of shoes is time better spent than baseball.  Baseball never helped me with anything but a nice pair of shoes has helped me win a job interview.  Other than spending time with my father, I don’t think baseball has ever done anything positive for anyone.  
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				I didn’t have to do any deep research this week. I had a bunch of official-looking people following me around. One on my back porch. She will be walking with a limp for a few weeks. I will investigate and let my faithful readers know what I find.

			<h2>Robin Hood of Pirates</h2> 
			<p class="author"><b>Dr. S. Beakman - 2019-09-05</b></p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				I had no idea Dr. Michael Jordan played baseball.  I can only guess that after being named <q>The world's most influential computer scientist</q><sup>1</sup> he needed a new challenge.  I am not quite sure why he choose baseball.   Maybe, he enjoyed calculating the physics of hitting a ball.  I did some research on my own, and it appears that hitting a ball with a stick will attract the fairer sex.  I am not sure how this phenomenon works, but I understand that it can be important to certain Cro Magnon-minded males.  No offense, Ed.  It also could be that he had some unresolved issues from childhood.  Some of us overly intelligent professionals miss out on youthful activities.  In my youth, I wanted to be a pirate.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				As I would engineer my kites, I would imagine them being large sales that would propel my ships worldwide.  People consider pirates nefarious, but I would be an honorable pirate.  Instead of causing vast destruction, I would liberate the populace to be free and powerful.  When I navigate my large sea-bound vessel back into a port, I imagine being met with pickles thrown at my feet.  Unless, we landed in Italy, where they would shower me with olives.
			</p> 
			<p class="paragraph">
				After years of sailing the ocean blue, I would be the best with a pool cue.  At least, I assume using a sword would make me a better pool player.  Maybe instead, I would master the bow and arrow.  I would be the Robin Hood of pirates.
